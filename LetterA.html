    <h1>LOVE</h1>
    <p class="stanza1">From the very beginning, the girl's family objected strongly on her dating this guy. Saying that it has got to do with family background & that the girl will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she were to be with him.</p>
    <p class="stanza2">Due to family's pressure, the couple quarrel very often. Though the girl loved the guy deeply, she always asked him: "How deep is your love for me?"</p>
    <p class="stanza3">As the guy was not good with words, this often caused the girl to be very upset. With the family's pressure, she often vented her anger on him. He only endured it in silence.</p>
    <p class="stanza4">After a couple of years, the guy graduated and decided to further his studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will you marry me?"</p>
    <p class="stanza5">The girl agreed, and with his determination, the family finally gave in. Before he left, they got engaged.</p>
    <p class="stanza6">The girl started working, while he was overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love through emails and phone calls. Though it was hard, they never thought of giving up.</p>
    <p class="stanza7">One day, while on her way to work, she was hit by a car. When she woke up, she realized she had lost her voice. Listening to her parents’ comfort but unable to respond, she broke down.</p>
    <p class="stanza8">During her hospital stay, she could only cry silently. Upon returning home, the ringing phone pierced her heart. She wrote to him, saying she didn’t wish to wait any longer and returned the ring.</p>
    <p class="stanza9">The guy sent countless replies, but all she could do was cry. Her parents moved to help her forget. She learned sign language and tried to start anew.</p>
    <p class="stanza10">One day, she received a wedding invitation from him. She was shattered, but upon opening it, saw her own name. Then he appeared, using sign language to say, "I've spent a year learning sign language to fulfill our promise. I want to be your voice. I Love You."</p>
    <p class="stanza11">With that, he slipped the ring back on her finger. The girl finally smiled.</p> <br> <br>
